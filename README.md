# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

It sets up: routing and middleware for handling requests and responses (CRUD); integration of the database through Mongoose models and schemas; and controller functions for managing error-handling and other logic.

## Technologies

- Server-side Node.js
- Introductory Express.js
- MongoDB database
- Mongoose ODM library for MongoDB
- ESLint linting utility

### Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
